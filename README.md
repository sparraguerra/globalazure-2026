# 3 AI Agents, Real Tools and Models -- All on Azure Container Apps with Foundry

A multi-agent content factory that researches Microsoft technology topics, creates multi-format content, and generates podcasts. Built to familiarize with running and hosting AI Agents on Azure Container Apps, explore agent observability, and register and evaluate agents in Microsoft Foundry.

> **Lab participants:** follow the instructor or check [the full lab manual](Lab/docs/lab-manual.md).

## Architecture

```
[Dev UI] --> [Agent 1 - Researcher] --> [Agent 2 - Content Creator] --> [Agent 3 - Podcaster]
```

Enter a topic (e.g. *"Write a comprehensive blog post about Azure Container Apps for developers"*). Three agents collaborate:

1. **Agent 1 — Tech Research** (LangGraph / Python) — Searches Microsoft Learn, Azure Blog, Tech Community, Azure Updates, and GitHub. Uses AI for intent detection, ranks sources by relevance, fetches full content from top hits, follows depth-1 links from trusted domains, and synthesizes a research brief.
2. **Agent 2 — Content Creator** (Microsoft Agent Framework / .NET) — Transforms the research brief into an original blog post, LinkedIn post, and Twitter thread, all grounded in real sources.
3. **Agent 3 — Podcaster** (GitHub Copilot SDK / Python) — Creates an engaging podcast script and generates audio. Can use Azure OpenAI TTS or a custom XTTS-v2 server on serverless GPUs.

**Dev UI** — A lightweight HTML frontend for submitting topics and viewing results from all three agents.

Agents communicate via the **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol** — each exposes a `/.well-known/agent.json` card for discovery and a `/a2a` JSON-RPC endpoint for task submission. Each agent runs as a separate container on Azure Container Apps.

## Deploy to Azure

```bash
azd up
```

This creates: Azure AI Foundry (GPT-4o + TTS), ACR, ACA Environment, Log Analytics, Storage Account, and Container Apps for each agent plus the Dev UI.

## Run Locally

With Docker Compose:

```bash
cd Lab
cp .env.example .env  # fill in your Azure OpenAI credentials
docker compose up     # starts agents 1-3 + dev-ui
```

Without Docker, see the step-by-step guide: [Lab/docs/how-to-run-locally.md](Lab/docs/how-to-run-locally.md).

## Talk Materials

- [Lab/docs/stop-building-apis-forge-agents-talk-guide.md](Lab/docs/stop-building-apis-forge-agents-talk-guide.md) — project explanation, demo narrative, and audience Q&A for the session.
